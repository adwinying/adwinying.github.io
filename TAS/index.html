  <h1>The TAS Eulogy</h1>

  <h3>“The day has finally arrived. I knew it was bound to happen. There goes our 6k club funds. Heh”</h3>

  <p>&emsp;&emsp;All that and sarcasms aside, TAS (a long time ago) was just a gathering of 4 same members where they all watch anime every Friday. It grew so much within a span of 2-3 years, where we had Cosplay Cafes as well as winning the Best Club Award and Best Hallmark Event Award from the SDC. At the peak of its life, TAS was a club that was not just about anime, but all things Japanese – J-pop, manga, culture etc. It was a club that tried to accommodate everyone’s interests, whether you’re an otaku or a weeaboo, whether you’re into dank memes or BL, there was always a place for everyone. We aimed to create a club where people could escape the hectic college life, hence our motto – “Passionately dedicated to FUN”. Of course, this may sound like an easy thing to do, but behind the scenes there was more than meets the eye.</p>

  <p>&emsp;&emsp;In order to create the fun atmosphere that our members enjoyed, countless hours of work is done by the committee. Mind you, planning meetings every week isn’t an easy task. At one point, the TAS committee had grew to over 10+ members just to accommodate the increasing workload assigned to us. Everything behind the scenes was serious business and rarely fun – committees sacrifice in order to make TAS even better for its members. From having committee meetings twice a week for 2 hours minimum, to waking up in the middle of the night to complete a poster that’s urgently needed the next day – the amount of dedication and soul put into the club was what allowed us and the rest of the TAS members to have a taste of success. Till today, the TAS committee of my time was the dream team to me; it felt like we could accomplish anything we want, regardless of any potential difficulties.</p>

  <p>&emsp;&emsp;Many hurdles remain though – from the club's reputation as a gathering of only weeaboos to the short college life which makes it harder to pass down the ropes to the next generation thoroughly. We had the naïve expectation that the next generation shall retain our performance as well as overcoming some of the problems that we couldn’t solve, continuing on the TAS legacy for many years to come. Sadly, with my ~5 years of experience in clubs and societies management, by observing just one of each meeting (weekly and committee) after stepping down from the committee for 3 years continuously, I knew that the TAS legacy had reached its peak – its downfall is eminent. </p>

  <p>&emsp;&emsp;Year after year, I hoped someone could prove my predictions wrong; but sadly it remains true and eventually, proven. Minor problems that was a no-brainer in the past kept accumulating, ranging from management to responsibilities. Alas all these issues piled up and the committee could not function to its expected capacity. Work couldn’t be done by the given time period, weekly meetings were no longer the norm, and people start leaving the club, until the only one member remains during the weekly meetings – the president himself, watching anime alone.</p>

  <p>&emsp;&emsp;Before we point fingers at each other, I strongly believe that everyone here is part of the reason of TAS’ downfall, including myself. Anyone reading this is probably at fault, whether you’re a senpai, a committee member, or a TAS member that just drops by in once in a while. Without anyone of us, TAS will eventually crumble and fall. Where did we go wrong? What can we do to fix this? It’s too late for any questions, all we could do now is to move on. If we found the answers to these questions, let the answers be served as an important lesson, and helps us prevent similar encounters in the future.</p>

  <p>&emsp;&emsp;To those who hope the club dies and turn into ashes, congratulations and today may probably be your lucky day. To those who lost a place to hang out and chill, there’s always the Facebook group. As for whether TAS should be restarted in the future, I don’t know. If there ever was someone passionate about restarting TAS, I would say why not. If there was ever a TAS memory that you’re fond of, may it be etched deep into your heart, bringing you smiles whenever it comes up.</p>

  <h1>Long live TAS.</h1>
